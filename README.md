# pdf_structured_data
Extract text from pdf to be structured into sentences.

This model uses the dertp-doc-table-detection model from hugging face (https://huggingface.co/TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection) to extract tables. 

This model deletes the images and tries to create sentences by only using the free text that exists in a PDF.

This classes are used for my master thesis project.
